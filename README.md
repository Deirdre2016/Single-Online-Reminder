# Single-Online-Reminder
This is a college project creating a Single Online Reminder using JSONBLOB API.  It was created using Ionic framewrok and Angular JS.

The APK is included in zip file.

When the user opens the reminder app, he can create a new reminder by entering data.  When the data is saved it is stored onto jsonblob API.  When the reminder is amended, it is updated and again stored on API.  When delete is pressed, the reminder is fully deleted on app and jsonblob API.  The created date and time are also recorded (although hidden on app, only shown on jsonblob API).
